I love **solving problems**, exploring new tech, and learning by doing.  
This is my little corner to share **projects, experiments, and coding adventures** — all the wins, lessons, and “oops” moments included! 💖  

## 🛠️ My Toolkit
- **Languages:** C, C++, Shell  
- **Tools:** Git, Vim, VSCode, Makefile  
- **42 Projects:** Rushes, Piscine, PiscineReloaded, CommonCore… and more!

## 🌟 Why 42Porto is My Playground
42Porto is *all about curiosity and creativity*.  
- Peer-to-peer learning 💡

It’s a place to **try, fail, learn, and grow** — and I’m loving every minute of it!  

## 🏗️ Featured Projects
